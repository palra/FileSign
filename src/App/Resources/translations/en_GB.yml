        q1:
            question: "How does the authenticity verification system work?"
            response: |
                    We use the principle of asymmetric cryptography, including RSA keys. The signature file is generated with the SHA512 algorithm, which helps to detect even the slightest changes in the source file. Try it by yourself: change the file very slightly, and you will see that the file will be identified as non-authentic.
        q2:
            question: "I would like to check the authenticity of a document, but I have no signature. What do I do?"
            response: Ask your translator to send you the digital signature file.
        q3:
            question: "I'd like to check the authenticity of my document myself. How do I do that?"
            response: "If you are asking this question, you know beforehand how the digital signature verification works. So, you can download <a href=\"%href%\">our public key</a> and verify the authenticity of the document yourself."
